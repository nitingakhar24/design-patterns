Implementation of some of the important GoF design patterns

Types of pattern

**Creational**: The design patterns that deal with the creation of an object.

**Structural**: The design patterns in this category deals with the class structure such as Inheritance and Composition.

**Behavioral**: This type of design patterns provide solution for the better interaction between objects, how to provide lose coupling, and flexibility to extend easily in future.

Some commonly used **Creational** design patterns

**SINGLETON PATTERN** :- The singleton pattern is a software design pattern that restricts the instantiation of a class to a singular instance. It can be implemented using Lazy or Eager initilization method.
**FACTORY PATTERN** :-  This is used when we have a superclass with multiple sub-classes and based on input, we need to return one of the sub-class. This pattern takes out the responsibility of the instantiation of a class from the client program to the factory class. It  makes our code more robust, loosely coupled and easy to extend.
